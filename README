'''VIM'''

This is how I configure my vim environment.

symlink your .vmirc to the vimrc file in the root of this
repository.

If you are cloning this on a new system, you must run
the following commands in the roort of your repo
to get the submodules to show up in the bundle/ directory.

 git submodule init
 git submodule update

here is a nice link to learn more about submodules:
